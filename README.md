Speech Emotion Recognizer

Summary:

The Speech Emotion Recognizer project is an application developed using Flask, HTML, CSS, Python, and XAMPP database technology. It is designed to analyze speech recordings, determine the emotional content within them, and provide visualization of the audio waveform.

Features:

Emotion Recognition: The core functionality of the application lies in its ability to recognize emotions from speech recordings. Using machine learning algorithms, it analyzes the audio input and classifies it into various emotional categories such as happy, sad, angry, etc.
Audio Visualization: The application offers a visual representation of the audio waveform. This feature allows users to see the intensity and pattern of the sound over time, aiding in better understanding and interpretation of the emotional content.
Record Audio: Users can record their own audio directly within the application interface. This enables real-time analysis of speech and immediate feedback on the emotional expression conveyed.
Input Data Analysis: Apart from recording audio, users can also input pre-existing audio files for emotion analysis. This flexibility allows for the analysis of a wide range of audio sources, including interviews, speeches, or any recorded conversation.
Database Integration: The project utilizes XAMPP database technology for storing and managing user data. This includes recorded audio files, analysis results, and any additional information collected during the interaction with the application.

HOW TO USE:

1.Ensure that XAMPP server is running to enable database functionality.

2.Launch the Flask environment to start the application.

3.Access the application through a web browser.

4.Choose between recording audio or inputting pre-existing audio files.

5.Once the audio is processed, view the emotional analysis results.

6.Explore the visual representation of the audio waveform for further insights.
